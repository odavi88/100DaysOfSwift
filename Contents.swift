// Using String Interperlation

let tracersCatchPhrase = "\(characterName) enjoys saying \(catchPhrase)."
print(tracersCatchPhrase)

let firstName = "Omar"
let age = 29

let introduction = "Hello! My name is \(firstName) and I'm \(age)."
print(introduction)


// NOTE: You can pass in calculations into your String Interperlation

print("1 plus 2 is \(1 + 2).")


// MARK: Summary so far...

// NOTE: Swift allows us to create constants using "let" and variables using "var".
//
// use "let" over "var" for optimized code and to cut down on errors later in your code.
//
// NOTE: Swift's strings contain text, from short to long novels and include helpful dote functions to modify your text.
//
// To make a new string use double quotes at the start and end of the text.
// NOTE: if you want multi-lined strings use three quotes at the start and end of the text.
//
// NOTE: To store whole numbers use Intergers, or Int.
// Intergers have fucntionality to like ".isMultipleOf"
//
// NOTE: To store Decimal numbers use Double.
    //WARNING: Dont use Doubles to track money as they are not the most acurate way to store that data.
//
// NOTE: To store True or False data, use Booleans, or Bool.
//
// NOTE: Use String Interpolation to most efficiently combine strings and/or other data types, like Int, Bool, or Doubles.
